# Basic Image Classifier with Keras

This project implements a basic image classifier using the Keras deep learning library. In this project, we will:

- Load the MNIST dataset of hand-written digits.
- Design a deep learning model architecture.
- Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance.
- Save the trained model for later use.
- Load the saved model and use it to classify new images.

## Introduction

In this code, we implement a basic image classifier using Keras, a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

## Dataset

We use the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits widely used for training various image processing systems. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
